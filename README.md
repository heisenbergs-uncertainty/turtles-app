Turtles All The Way Down: Application Development Plan
Overview
The "Turtles All The Way Down" application is a centralized platform for presenting verified facts on vaccine safety and efficacy, inspired by the book Turtles All The Way Down: Vaccine Science and Myth. The backend uses Go with the gen tool (built on GORM) for type-safe database interactions, chosen for its rapid development, mature ecosystem, and scalability. The app supports web and Electron-based desktop frontends (Windows, macOS) for the MVP, with plans for iOS/Android in phase 2. It includes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for roles like Admin, Doctor, Researcher, Scientist, Contributor, Parent, and Viewer, secure anonymously contributed content via AWS KMS, and features to reflect the book’s arguments (e.g., safety testing, herd immunity), 1,200+ references, counterpoints, interactive visualizations, moderated discussions, and transparency about the book’s authorship and affiliations.
Goals

Centralized Information Hub: Present the book’s arguments, evidence, and counterpoints to foster informed decision-making.
Cross-Platform Support: Deliver web, desktop (Electron), and future mobile apps.
Scalability and Maintainability: Build a modular, scalable backend using Go and gen.
Security and Trust: Ensure data integrity, user privacy, and secure anonymous contributions.
Extensibility: Support RBAC, community discussions, and future enhancements.

Rationale for Choosing Go
Go was selected over Rust based on:

Rapid Development: Simple syntax and gen/GORM enable a 3.75-month MVP timeline.
Mature Ecosystem: Libraries like Gin, casbin (RBAC), and jwt-go support REST APIs, authentication, and access control.
Concurrency: Goroutines handle 10,000 concurrent users efficiently for I/O-bound tasks.
Deployment: Single-binary output simplifies Docker/Kubernetes and Electron integration.
Community: Large community ensures maintainability.Rust was excluded due to its steeper learning curve, less mature web ecosystem, and complexity in async programming, which could delay the MVP without significant benefits for this I/O-bound application.

Step-by-Step Plan
Step 1: Define Requirements and Scope
Objective: Establish functional and non-functional requirements to guide development.
Tasks:

Functional Requirements:
Display content categorized by book chapters (e.g., Safety Testing, Herd Immunity, Adverse Events, Historical Declines, Institutional Bias).
Include a searchable reference library with 1,200+ sources (scientific papers, government documents, manufacturer data), with annotations and links.
Present counterarguments from credible sources (e.g., CDC, WHO) alongside book claims for balance.
Enable search by keyword, vaccine type, disease, or source credibility; filter references by source type, vaccine, or disease; sort by date or relevance.
Provide interactive tools (e.g., timelines of disease declines, trial design charts) and primers on scientific concepts (e.g., RCTs, placebo controls, herd immunity, VAERS).
Support moderated discussion forums with RBAC for verified roles (e.g., Contributors, Researchers).
Implement RBAC for roles: Admin, Doctor, Researcher, Scientist, Contributor, Parent, Viewer (read-only).
Allow verified Contributors to submit content anonymously, with encrypted credential storage (AWS KMS).
Enable CRUD operations for content, references, and counterpoints; include approval workflow for Admins.
Support multilingual content and references.
Display book authorship (anonymous, edited by Zoey O’Toole and Mary Holland) and Children’s Health Defense (CHD) affiliation with context on their vaccine-skeptic stance.
Support web and Electron-based desktop apps (Windows, macOS) for MVP; plan for iOS/Android in phase 2.

Non-Functional Requirements:
Achieve 99.9% uptime; scale for 10,000 concurrent users.
Ensure secure data transmission (HTTPS, JWT, KMS).
Deliver responsive web app and consistent desktop UX.
Maintain data integrity with versioned content and audit logs.

Initial Scope:
Focus on web and Electron apps for MVP.
Include core content, references, counterpoints, search, RBAC, anonymous contributions, discussions, and transparency features.
Plan for iOS/Android in phase 2.

Choices and Explanation:

Web and Electron apps maximize reach (web for accessibility, desktop for offline use).
Reference library and counterpoints reflect the book’s evidence-based approach while addressing bias concerns.
Discussion forums foster engagement; RBAC ensures credible contributions.
Transparency on authorship and CHD affiliation builds trust.
Go’s simplicity accelerates MVP delivery within 3.75 months.

Step 2: Design Software Architecture
Objective: Create a modular, scalable architecture to support cross-platform frontends.
Architecture:

Backend: RESTful API built with Go, following a layered architecture (Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access).
Frontend:
Web app using React.js for MVP.
Desktop apps (Windows, macOS) using Electron, reusing web codebase.
Future iOS app (Swift/SwiftUI) in phase 2.

Database: PostgreSQL for relational data; optional Elasticsearch for enhanced search.
Authentication: JWT with RBAC; AWS KMS for encrypted contributor credentials.
Deployment: Docker containers orchestrated with Kubernetes, hosted on AWS.
Content Delivery: AWS CloudFront for static assets and cached content.

Layered Backend Architecture:

Presentation Layer:
Handles HTTP requests/responses.
Exposes REST endpoints (e.g., /api/v1/content, /api/v1/references, /api/v1/discuss).
Uses Go’s Gin for routing.

Business Logic Layer:
Implements content retrieval, reference management, counterpoint integration, search, RBAC, anonymous contributions, and discussion moderation.
Enforces role-based permissions using casbin.

Data Access Layer:
Uses gen-generated query interfaces (built on GORM) for database operations.
Manages encrypted contributor credentials via AWS KMS.

External Services:
Elasticsearch for full-text search (optional).
AWS S3 for storing files (e.g., study PDFs).
AWS KMS for encryption key management.

Diagram:
[Web/Electron/iOS Frontend] <-> [REST API (Go)] <-> [PostgreSQL/Elasticsearch] <-> [AWS S3/CDN/KMS]

gen Configuration:

Define Go structs in models package:type Content struct {
ID uuid.UUID `gorm:"type:uuid;primaryKey"`
Title string `gorm:"type:varchar(255)"`
Body string `gorm:"type:text"`
Category string `gorm:"type:varchar(50)"`
VaccineType string `gorm:"type:varchar(50)"`

id := c.Param("id")
db := c.MustGet("db").(*gen.Dao)
content, err := db.Content.Where(db.Content.ID.Eq(uuid.MustParse(id))).First()
if err != nil {
c.JSON(http.StatusNotFound, gin.H{"error": "Content not found"})
return
}
references, _ := db.Reference.Where(db.Reference.ContentID.Eq(uuid.MustParse(id))).Find()
counterpoints, _ := db.Counterpoint.Where(db.Counterpoint.ContentID.Eq(uuid.MustParse(id))).Find()
c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{
"content": content,
"references": references,
"counterpoints": counterpoints,
})
}
